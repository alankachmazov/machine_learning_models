# machine_learning_models

In this project diffrenet machine learning models are built using python scikit-learn and torch packages for binary classification of two open source datasets for churn preiction in combination with different types of feature reducion techniques. Following machine learning models are built: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbouts (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). For feature reduction Principle Components Analysis (PCA), Random Forest and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are utilized. Also a metaheuristic algorithm Grey Wolf Optimizer is used to find optimal configuration of Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

In this repository you can find: 
1. README file
2. internet_service_churn.csv - open source dataset taken from Kaggle. 
3. Telco_customer_churn_cleaned.csv - open source dataset taken from Kaggle.
4. main.py - main file containing code.

Following packages were used: pandas, numpy, sklearn, torch, matplotlin and seaborn.
